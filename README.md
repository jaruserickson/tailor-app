## About

Tailor is an app that unifies the food ordering and eating experience and tailors it to you. Gone are the days of spending hours deciding where to eat!

We use Pattern Recognition to detect your favourite bites to eat and reccomend new places, or old places to go to, or order straight from the app if available.

## Technology Stack

- React Native
- GraphQL
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB
- DigitalOcean
- mLab

## Supported APIs

- [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3)
- [Just Eat](http://public.je-apis.com/swagger-ui/)
- [Uber](https://www.ubereats.com/) (when that happens)
- [Foodora](https://foodora.ca) (when that happens)

## Gameplan

Since Uber and Foodora lack APIs i'm going to beautifulsoup the heck out of them and enter the address and scrape the restaurants via python. Uber will require text entry while foodora CAN use url manipulation, but is gross and i'll have to do some button pressing there. Buttons for ubereats and foodora will be disabled but show if exists while just eat will order :).
